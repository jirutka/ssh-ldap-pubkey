This project provides an utility to manage SSH public keys stored in LDAP and also a script for
OpenSSH server to load authorized keys from LDAP.


Why?
----

When you have dozen of servers it becomes difficult to manage your authorized keys. You have to
copy all your public keys to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on every server you want to login to. And
what if you someday change your keys?

It’s a good practice to use some kind of a centralized user management, usually an LDAP server.
There you have user’s login, uid, e-mail, … and password. What if we could also store public SSH
keys on LDAP server? With this utility it’s easy as pie.


Requirements
------------

This utility depends on [python-ldap] which (unfortunately) requires Python 2.×.

It is available in most distributions as `python-ldap` package; it should be installed before
`ssh-ldap-pubkey` unless you want to compile it yourself.

Alternatively you can install `python-ldap` from PyPI, which requires additional system
dependencies (OpenLDAP). Refer to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/4768446/240963) for
distribution-specific information.


Installation
------------

Install from PyPI:

    pip install ssh-ldap-pubkey

…or if you’re using Gentoo (good choice!), then you can use [sys-auth/ssh-ldap-pubkey][ebuild]
ebuild from the [CVUT Overlay][cvut-overlay].


Usage
-----

List SSH public keys stored in LDAP for the current user:

    ssh-ldap-pubkey list

List SSH public keys stored in LDAP for the specified user:

    ssh-ldap-pubkey list -u flynn

Add the specified SSH public key for the current user to LDAP:

    ssh-ldap-pubkey add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Remove SSH public key(s) of the current user that matches the specified pattern:

    ssh-ldap-pubkey del flynn@grid

Specify LDAP URI and base DN on command line instead of configuration file:

    ssh-ldap-pubkey list -b ou=People,dc=encom,dc=com -H ldaps://encom.com -u flynn

As the LDAP manager, add SSH public key to LDAP for the specified user:

    ssh-ldap-pubkey add -D cn=Manager,dc=encom,dc=com -u flynn ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Show help for other options:

    ssh-ldap-pubkey --help


Configuration
-------------

Configuration is read from /etc/ldap.conf — file used by LDAP nameservice switch library and the
LDAP PAM module. An example file is included in [etc/ldap.conf][ldap.conf]. The following subset of
parameters are used:

*  **uri** ... URI of the LDAP server to connect to. The URI scheme may be ldap, or ldaps.
               Default is `ldap://localhost`.
*  **nss_base_passwd** ... distinguished name (DN) of the search base.
*  **base** ... distinguished name (DN) of the search base. Used when *nss_base_passwd* is not set.
*  **scope** ... search scope; _sub_, _one_, or _base_ (default is _sub_).
*  **pam_filter** ... filter to use when searching for the user’s entry, additional to the login
        attribute value assertion (`pam_login_attribute=<login>`). Default is
        _objectclass=posixAccount_.
*  **pam_login_attribute** ... the user ID attribute (default is _uid_).
*  **ldap_version** ... LDAP version to use (default is 3).
*  **binddn** ... distinguished name (DN) to bind when reading the user’s entry (default is to bind
                  anonymously).
*  **bindpw** ... credentials to bind with when reading the user’s entry (default is none).
*  **ssl** ... LDAP SSL mechanism (off, on, start_tls)
*  **timelimit** ... search time limit in seconds (default is 10).
*  **bind_timelimit** ... bind/connect time limit in seconds (default is 10).
*  **tls_cacertdir** ... path of the directory with CA certificates for LDAP server certificate
                         verification.

The only required parameter is *nss_base_passwd* or _base_, others have sensitive defaults. You
might want to define _uri_ parameter as well. These parameters can be also defined/overriden
with `--bind` and `--uri` options on command line.

For more information about these parameters refer to ldap.conf man page.


Setup OpenSSH server
--------------------

To configure OpenSSH server to fetch users’ authorized keys from LDAP server:

1.  Make sure that you have installed **ssh-ldap-pubkey** and **ssh-ldap-pubkey-wrapper** in
    `/usr/bin` with owner `root` and mode `0755`.
2.  Add these two lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

        AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/bin/ssh-ldap-pubkey-wrapper
        AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

3.  Restart sshd and check log file if there’s no problem.

Note: This method is supported by OpenSSH since version 6.2-p1 (or 5.3 onRedHat). If you have an
older version and can’t upgrade, for whatever weird reason, use [openssh-lpk] patch instead.


Setup LDAP server
------------------

Just add the [openssh-lpk.schema] to your LDAP server, **or** add an attribute named `sshPublicKey`
to any existing schema which is already defined in people entries. That’s all.

Note: Presumably, you’ve already setup your LDAP server for centralized unix users management,
i.e. you have the [NIS schema](http://www.zytrax.com/books/ldap/ape/nis.html) and users in LDAP.
